<p class="tb">I purpose writing a brief history of Fort Worth from the time
of its selection as a military post down to the time within the memory
of men now living, who may be interested in the struggles and
sacrifices made by those who laid the foundation of the City. I
purpose giving somewhat in detail the work of these patriotic, public-spirited
men to whom the present citizenship of the City owe so much.</p>
<p>I am inspired to do this for the reason that so much credit is
given by the uninformed to men to whom no credit is due and so
much is withheld from those who bore the burden and heat of the
day in times that tried men&rsquo;s souls, and to whom no sacrifice was
too great, no demand upon their time or purse too much, if it could
be shown that Fort Worth was to derive a benefit from the expenditure
of time or money. The good that men do should live after
them. But men should not have the credit for deeds done in the body
when the deeds were never performed. Obituary notices are useful
as examples to the living, but to be useful they should be true.
Men should not be given credit, even though it may make pleasant
reading to the families of the deceased, for things they did not do
and perhaps had not the means of doing, no matter how willing
they may have been.</p>
<p>In the early days of this city there was among its citizenship a
coterie of men, the like of which were never found in any other community.
Their first and only thought was for the upbuilding of the
city. Some of these men are still living, but most of them have
gone to their reward. It is greatly to be regretted that all could
not have lived to see the culmination of their efforts and to participate
in the prosperity which they helped to bring to the city.</p>
<p>In what follows there shall be found &ldquo;nothing extenuate, nor
aught set down in malice.&rdquo; It will be &ldquo;an o&rsquo;er true tale&rdquo; as I saw it
I do not hope that this little volume will be complete but that it may
serve as a foundation for some future historian to erect a structure
as voluminous and veracious as Gibbon&rsquo;s Rome or Hume and Smollett&rsquo;s
England. As far as it goes it may be regarded more authentic
and reliable than Knickerbocker&rsquo;s History of New York.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_2">2</div>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">FIRST SETTLEMENT OF FORT WORTH.</span></h2>
<p>At the close of the war with Mexico, General Winfield Scott
sent a troop of the Second Dragoons in command of Major Ripley
A. Arnold to North Texas to establish a post to protect the then
sparsely settled territory from the forays of the Indians which
then inhabited this section.</p>
<p>Major Arnold selected this as the most central point for this
purpose.</p>
<p>The post was first called Camp Worth in honor of Brigadier
General William Jennings Worth. It was established on the sixth
day of June, 1849. On November 14th, 1849, the name was changed
to Fort Worth, and it was abandoned on the 17th day of September,
1853, and the troops stationed here were sent to Fort Belknap, about
a mile from the present site of the town of Belknap. There was
never a fort at this point and the only buildings were the barracks at
the head of and a little west of Houston street.</p>
<p>The first settlement in the county of any magnitude grew up
about the military post and on its abandonment the buildings were
used as stores by those who had settled near the post. Among
those who were in business here were Col. Abe Harris, who at
this writing still lives in the city, the late James F. Ellis and G. P.
Farmer who subsequently located a farm about twelve miles south
of the city.</p>
<p>When the soldiers left there was only a meagre country population
in the vicinity; barring a few supply trains no current of trade
had yet begun to flow through this section of Texas. There were no
cattle trails; nothing permanent to arouse enthusiasm for this straggling
settlement on the Trinity Bluff and the seed of civilization
planted and protected during the brief military occupancy, might,
on good and relative grounds, have experienced the same blight that
befell Fort Phantom Hill and Fort Belknap.</p>
<p>But this nucleus of citizens, among whom, besides those named,
were E. M. Daggett, C. M. Peak and John Peter Smith, whose
names later became associated with every enterprise in which the
city was interested.</p>
<p>The County was created by the Legislature in December, 1849,
and the county seat was located at Birdville. The spirit of conquest
was rife in the veins of the early settlers and at the instance of
Capt. Daggett and others, the Legislature was induced to permit an
election to decide upon the county seat. Birdville was at that time
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
the larger place. Had the election been untrammeled it would have
probably remained the seat of government for many years. The
citizens of Birdville charged, and there seems good reason for the
charge, that the election of Fort Worth was brought about by the
votes of Sam Woody, the first settler of Wise County, and the members
of his family. Enough was shown to induce the Legislature to
order a second election. About 1855, A. J. Walker who lived a few
miles northeast of Birdville was a member of the State Senate.
He was instrumental in having a bill passed providing for another
election. This occurred about the year 1860. The exact date is not
accessible to the writer. By this time the population of Fort Worth
had increased to sufficient numbers to enable it to make good its
claim as the proper place for the court house. Birdville abandoned
its claim and endeavored to defeat Fort Worth by casting its votes
and throwing its influence for &ldquo;The center of the county&rdquo; which
would be a little nearer Birdville than Fort Worth. The vote resulted
in 301 for &ldquo;the center&rdquo; and 548 for Fort Worth and the
vexed question which has cost the lives of some and the expenditure
of about $30,000 was settled for all time.</p>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">ABOUT THE INDIANS.</span></h2>
<p>An effort was made in 1873 to remove all the hostile Indians
from Texas to the Reservation in the Indian Territory. The removal
was accomplished but it was not easy to keep them there,
and there were occasional raids across the border and into the settlements.
The exact date of the last foray is not accessible at this writing,
but it was made as far south as Jack and Young counties, just
west of Los Valley where James C. Loving had a ranch and his
residence. The foray was led by two Indian Chiefs, Santanta and
Big Tree. They fell upon a wagon train conveying supplies to
Fort Griffin which stood about fourteen miles northwest of the
present town of Albany. It was owned by Capt. Julian Feild, of
this city, and Henry Warren, of Weatherford. The train was destroyed;
the wagons burned; the mules and horses taken away
and several men killed. A wooden monument marks the place where
the encounter took place. Troops were dispatched after the savages
and the two chiefs were captured. They were tried for murder
at Jacksboro and convicted and sentenced to death, but the sentence
was commuted by Edmund J. Davis, then Governor of Texas, to confinement
in the penitentiary for life. Santanta was afterwards
pardoned and at last accounts was still living on the Reservation
near Fort Sill, Oklahoma.</p>
<p>On August 16th, 1874, another raid was made into Texas, coming
as far as Veal&rsquo;s station about three miles west of the present town
of Springtown, where one man was killed. Two others were killed by
the same raiders on the Weatherford and Jacksboro road, about half
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
way between the two towns. This was the last appearance of hostile
Indians in this part of the State. There were other forays on the
borders of New Mexico subsequent to that time.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">CREDIT TO WHOM CREDIT IS DUE.</span></h2>
<p>When it comes to calling the roll of patriots who worked so
long and faithfully for the upbuilding of the city one ventures upon
dangerous ground. The memory is at times treacherous and some of
the best and truest are liable to be over-looked. But that their names
may be enshrined in the hearts of the people and perpetuated by
this modest record of the time the chance will be taken. It would
be well to dig up the tax rolls of that day and make a copy of it, for
every man in the city with but one or two conspicuous exceptions
was ready at any and all times to spend and be spent for the
good of Fort Worth.</p>
<p>But there were a few who were conspicuous by their liberality
whose names may be mentioned without any invidious distinction as
to others equally worthy. The first of these are the men who donated
three hundred and twenty acres of land lying along the southern
border of the city to the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway Company. These
men were E. M. Daggett, Major K. M. VanZandt, Thos. J. Jennings
and H. G. Hendricks. They were the ones to set the pace for their
fellow citizens.</p>
<p>Of those who contributed of their time and money without stint
may be mentioned those whose names are recorded above, who did
not stop with this princely donation and claim that they had done
their share; to these should be added John Peter Smith, Walter A.
Huffman, B. C. Evans, Joseph H. Brown, C. M. Peak, W. H. Davis,
William J. Boaz, James F. Ellis, M. G. Ellis, H. C. Holloway, J. J.
Jarvis. M. B. Loyd. W. W. Dunn. W. P. Burts. E. J. Beall, George
Newman, William B. Young, W. B. Tucker, Stephen Terry, Jesse
Jones, Dr. J. F. Shelton, A. J. Chambers, B. L. Samuels, John Hanna,
Porter King, W. A. Darter, Sam Seaton, Sam Evans, J. C. Terrell and
others. These are they who were here before the advent of the railroad
and many of them before there was any talk of a railroad.
When it was definitely settled that the road would be constructed
to this city the people commenced at once to reach out after other
enterprises and it may be truthfully stated that every man, woman
and child helped with time and money. Their names are enshrined
in the heart of every patriotic citizen of Fort Worth.</p>
<p>Among those who came to Fort Worth prior to the advent of the
railroad and who remained and gave of their time and money to
advance the interests of the city to the best of their ability and
who witnessed the culmination of their desires may be mentioned
Thos. A. Tidball, Zane-Cetti, C. K. Fairfax, J. J. Roche, F. J. Tatum,
J. S. Godwin, Jas. H. Field, Dahlman brothers, S. P. Greene, D. C.
Bennett, Geo. Mulkey, S. H. Hulkey, T. C. Boulware, the Pendery
brothers, P. J. Bowdry, J. Q. Sandige, J. Y. Hogsett, Jno. F. Swayne,
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
T. J. Peniston, D. B. Gardner, Z. E. B. Nash, I. Carb, J. M. Peers,
John Nichols, Jere Marklee, J. F. Cooper, D. C. Bennett, S. T. Bibb,
W. T. Maddox, and his brothers R. E., E. P., J. H. and a cousin J. M.
who now resides in Jack County. There are others, but their names
do not occur to the writer at this time.</p>
<p>Upon the arrival of the railroad and soon after, they came by
the carload. Among the most prominent, and who have been most
active in the upbuilding of the city may be mentioned W. G. Turner,
J. B. Burnside, A. J. Roe, Willard Burton, A. S. Dingee, J. M.
Hartsfield, A. J. Anderson, J. L. Cooper, J. W. Spencer, A. E.
Want, E. H. Keller, Neil P. Anderson, W. G. Newby, W. F. Sterley,
C. J. Swasey. Here, again, a lapse of time and defective memory
must be the excuse for not mentioning others equally worthy.</p>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">FIRST PROMINENCE OF THE CITY.</span></h2>
<p>Fort Worth first came into prominence in the year 1872. when
Col. Thomas A. Scott, who had come into the ownership and control
of the Texas &amp; Pacific Railway, in company with Col. John W. Forney,
the editor and proprietor of the &ldquo;Chronicle&rdquo; of Philadelphia, made
a trip across Texas for the purpose of selecting a route for this
road across the State. Colonel Forney wrote voluminous letters to
his paper describing in great detail what he saw and how he was
impressed with the resources of the State. He afterwards wrote and
published a pamphlet entitled &ldquo;What I Saw in Texas&rdquo; which had
a wide circulation.</p>
<p>In these letters and in the pamphlet he had much to say about
Fort Worth. In fact, he gave it more space than any other point
in the State, and predicted for it a brilliant future. He did not
hesitate to predict that it would be the most prominent place in the
northern part of the State. It being generally known that he was the
guest of Colonel Scott on the trip, it was quite natural that his
readers should reach the conclusion that he reflected the opinion
of the President of the Railway Company.</p>
<p>A secondary purpose of the trip across Texas and the presence of
Mr. Forney, then among the foremost editorial writers of the day, was
to educate the public and to influence it in favor of a grant or
subsidy from the general government in aid of the construction
of the road, such as had been granted to the Union Pacific Railroad.
A bill was then pending in Congress for this purpose. Forney&rsquo;s
paper as well as others in the east set forth with great emphasis
that this line would be of greater benefit to the nation at large than
the more northern route, inasmuch as it was in a more southerly
latitude and would be open for traffic every day of the year, and
would not be snowbound as it was contended the more northern
line would be at certain seasons of the year.</p>
<p>Col. Scott commenced the active work of construction westward
from Marshall and Jefferson immediately on his return from the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
Pacific slope and prosecuted it with all possible energy. He had associated
with him General Grenville M. Dodge who was the chief
engineer of the Union Pacific and Mr. Frank S. Bond who was
the financial director of the same road. The road was constructed
as fast as men and money could do the work and every argument
that could be devised was put forth to persuade representatives
in Congress that this line was of prime necessity to the commerce
of the country.</p>
<p>Representatives of the company attended every convention of importance
that was held in the country and resolutions were adopted
urging Congress to grant the southern route the same concessions
that had been given the northern line.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Col. Scott and his associates were bending every
energy to secure capital for the construction of the road. In the
summer of 1873, Scott went to Europe on this mission. It was reported,
from what was regarded as reliable sources, that he had
interested English capital in the enterprise and every one in North
Texas was rejoicing in his success. It was stated that so confident
was Col. Scott that he had provided a dinner at which all who were
in London, interested in the enterprise, participated in celebrating
his success. While the dinner was in progress a cablegram was received
announcing the suspension of the financial house of Jay Cooke
&amp; Co. This firm was the financial house of the general government
at that time. It was they who had carried on the negotiations for
the United States during the war and who had handled and marketed
the bonds issued to support the armies of the United States in that
great contest. This had given it the widest reputation throughout
the world and its failure wrought havoc in financial circles everywhere.
Very naturally it put an end to Scott&rsquo;s negotiations and he
returned to this country very much dejected but not at all dismayed
or discouraged.</p>
<p>It was a dark day for Fort Worth. The news fell upon this city
like a thunder bolt from a clear sky. From the highest point of
expectancy the people descended into the lowest depths of despondency.</p>
<p>When the work of the road had reached a point west of its
eastern terminal this side of Marshall, Fort Worth commenced to
grow. People came to the city from all points, but more numerously
from Kansas and Missouri. But they came from everywhere and
bought property, built houses and engaged in business. From
the fall of 1872 to that of 1873, Fort Worth grew from a little
hamlet of a few hundred into a bustling city of three or four
thousand. Rents were fabulous and business in all lines was active.
Fortunes were made in real estate and corner lots would double in
value in a night.</p>
<p>But the first day of September, the day of the suspension of
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
Jay Cooke &amp; Co. told another story. Values declined with as much
rapidity as they had grown up. People who had invested their money
and paid a part in cash and gave their notes for the remainder; who
had commenced the erection of houses that they were never to see
finished; who had ordered and in many instances received stocks
of goods for which there was no market saw bankruptcy staring
them in the face. Professional men from all over the country had
left comfortable homes and good business to come here and begin
their fortunes anew, faced inevitable ruin. The population dwindled
as rapidly as it had grown. Stores and dwellings were vacated by
the score. Business was at a standstill and gloom and despondency
was everywhere visible. The road to the eastward was filled with
people who were leaving the town in as large numbers as a few days
previous they had sought it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the road to which so many looked with expectancy
and hope was nearing Dallas. It was completed to about Forney,
east of Dallas, and the work was continued until the road reached
Eagle Ford, six miles west of Dallas, when it was discontinued and
the forces disbanded. Eagle Ford which had sprung into a town of
more than a thousand was as quickly depopulated&mdash;the people for the
most part moving back to Dallas. It was the opportunity for that
city. Had the panic broken thirty days later so that it would have
been practicable to have completed the road to Fort Worth before
suspending operations, Dallas would have been a good county seat
town instead of a thriving city and Fort Worth would today have
been a city of a quarter of a million population.</p>
<p>The decimation of Fort Worth left here about one thousand
people. Many of them stayed because they could not well get away.
Others remained because their faith in the ultimate growth and
preeminence of the city was not shaken by this disaster. They went
to work with a grim determination to make a city of Fort Worth
and how well they performed the task, many still living, well remember.
Their names are household words with the older citizens and
will never be forgotten. They are inscribed on the tablets of their
memories never to be effaced.</p>
<p>A great number of those who left Fort Worth at that time went
to Dallas. Some of them have become prominent factors in the development
of the city. There was little or no business left to Fort
Worth, except the spring cattle drive. That brought business to a
few. The town was dead as far as business and development went.
The grass literally grew in the streets. This was not a metaphor
to indicate stagnation, but a doleful fact. There were more empty
stores and vacant dwellings than those that were occupied. The
people busied themselves principally with an effort to devise ways
and means to secure a railroad and with politics in which they took an
interest that was keen and constant. Town meetings were almost
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
of weekly occurrence, and a sufficient number of resolutions were
adopted and committees appointed to have built the embankments for
a road to Dallas if they could have been utilized for that purpose.
The faith of the people never wavered for a moment. It was with
them constantly and under all circumstances. They never failed to
sing the praises of the city and to predict its glorious future.
Volumes were written and distributed telling of the glorious future
that waited upon those who believed and remained with the city.</p>
<p>Among those who left the place when the cyclone hit it was a
young lawyer who had come hither from Georgia. One Robert E.
Cowart. He went to Dallas where he still lives and is one of the promoters
of the scheme to get deep water in the Trinity at that place.
Cowart was, and is, a bright man. He has a keen sense of the ridiculous
and verbiage that can make an Indian&rsquo;s hair curl. He lived long
enough in Fort Worth to become acquainted with the peculiarities
of its people. It was he who furnished the facts that gave Fort
Worth the name of the &ldquo;Panther City.&rdquo; Knowing the conditions that
prevailed here, he wrote a communication for the Dallas Herald,
then the leading paper of North Texas, telling of the discovery of a
panther in the streets of Fort Worth, and the action taken by the
people.</p>
<p>No attempt was made to deny or explain the charge. It was
accepted as a fact. The town was by common consent christened
&ldquo;Pantherville.&rdquo; Every one named every thing &ldquo;Panther.&rdquo; There
were &ldquo;panther&rdquo; stores, &ldquo;panther&rdquo; meat markets, &ldquo;panther&rdquo; saloons.
The &ldquo;Democrat,&rdquo; a weekly paper, being printed here, secured a cut
of a panther couchant, which it displayed at the head of the paper.
A fire company organized at about that time named the engine the
&ldquo;Panther.&rdquo; Two panther cubs were advertised for and secured by
the local paper and they were housed in a handsome cage at the
firehall. When, a little later, Dallas gave a big celebration or demonstration
of some kind, the wagon with the panthers were taken
over there, drawn by four white horses and escorted by forty good
and patriotic citizens of the town clad in white uniforms. It was
easily the most attractive part of the procession on that occasion.
Fort Worth is still known as &ldquo;Pantherville,&rdquo; or the &ldquo;Panther City.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">FORT WORTH BECOMES A CITY.</span></h2>
<p>It has been stated that having nothing better to do&mdash;and there
are few better things to do&mdash;the people took an active interest in
politics. The first political movement of importance occurring about
that time was the incorporation of the city. The Thirteenth Legislature
in which Major K. M. VanZandt represented this county,
passed an act authorizing the incorporation and the people were
active in the preparation of a charter. Meetings were held almost
nightly in the Court House for this purpose. The most active participants
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
were John Y. Hogsett and Frank W. Ball who represented
the conflicting opinions.</p>
<p>The charter was effective March 1st, 1873, and the first city election
was held on the third day of April, following. The opposing
candidates for mayor were Dr. W. P. Burts and P. M. Thurmond.
The election was spirited and exciting. Most of the more recent
citizens were for Thurmond who was himself a &ldquo;new comer&rdquo; as they
were designated. When the votes were counted Dr. Burts was
elected by a majority of 68 votes. The total vote being 366. The other
officials were, Ed. Terrell, Marshal; N. M. Maben, Assessor and
Collector; F. W. Ball, City Attorney and J. F. Swayne, City Secretary.
The Board of Aldermen were, M. B. Loyd, M. D. McCall, A. Blakeney,
W. J. Boaz and A. G. Rintleman. There were twenty candidates
for alderman, all of whom but two have answered the last roll-call
and passed over the river.</p>
<p>When the panic of 1873 fell upon the country the city government
suspended business as far as practicable. The city officials agreed
to draw no salaries and depended on the fees of the Mayor&rsquo;s Court
for whatever compensation they received. All ordinances were suspended
except those pertaining to the preservation of the peace.
The city election was held at the proper time when Dr. Burts was
re-elected. The following comprised the official roster: T. M. Ewing,
City Marshal; John S. Loving, Treasurer; Theo. Hitchcock, Secretary;
G. F. Parnham, Collector and J. L. Chapman, City Attorney. The
Aldermen were R. H. King. A. B. Fraser. W. H. Overton, W. H.
Williams and Joseph H. Kane.</p>
<p>Among the defeated candidates for aldermen were: W. J. Boaz
and J. P. Alexander, who stood for re-election and Col. J. P. Smith.
Ewing resigned as City Marshal the following December and at an
election for his successor T. P. Redding, N. M. Maben and H. P.
Shiel were the candidates. Redding received 47 votes and Maben
and Shiel 68 votes each. Another election was ordered and Redding
withdrew and Columbus Fitzgerald, who had been the deputy of
Ewing entered the race and went off with the goods.</p>
<p>At the succeeding election Capt. G. H. Day and J. F. Cooper
were the rival candidates for mayor. Day received 206 votes and
Cooper 136. J. C. Scott was elected City Attorney; C. McDougall.
City Secretary; H. P. Shiel, City Marshal; G. F. Parmer, Assessor
and Collector; J. S. Loving, Treasurer. The Board of Aldermen
were W. T. Maddox, P. J. Bowdry, D. R. Crawford, Isaac Dahlman
and J. J. Jarvis.</p>
<p>Much interest was manifested in this election because of the
alleged profligacy of the former administration. The city debt had
been run up to the mammoth sum of $4,952.91 and something had
to be done or the city would be financially ruined. There was also
a delinquent tax list of $19.85 showing a gross lack of attention to
city affairs by those in authority.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>The next city election was probably the most exciting political
contest ever pulled off in this city. Capt. Day, who had been twice
mayor, was not in favor with a large number of people and a herculean
effort was made to defeat him. The aspirations of several good
men was a serious handicap to their efforts. The contest finally
settled down to Day, Larry Steele and John D. Templeton. When
the ballots were counted it was found that Day and Templeton were
tied and Steele three votes behind them. A second election was ordered
and Steele was prevailed upon to withdraw. The result was another
tie and a third election was ordered. Interested parties began to
scan the poll lists to ascertain if any fraudulent or illegal votes
had been cast when the discovery was made that B. B. Paddock,
who then lived where he now does, at the corner of Jennings Avenue
and Terrell Avenue, and Hugh W. Davis, who lived across the street
from him where John Laneri now lives, and both of whom were
outside of the city limits had voted in each election. Both were
and had been active in city affairs and it had not occurred to them
that they were not citizens of the city and allowed to participate
in the election and Day was elected by three votes. Paddock and
Davis had to behave themselves for a season and were threatened
with prosecution for illegal voting every time they became too
active in matters that did not concern them.</p>
<p>At the succeeding election Day was beaten by Col. R. E.
Beckham, who held the place for two terms when he declined to
again be a candidate. Col. John Peter Smith was chosen as his successor.
This is enough on this subject, although there were other
and interesting contests in the late 80&rsquo;s and early 90&rsquo;s.</p>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">RAILROADS.</span></h2>
<p>A volume might be written upon the struggles that Fort Worth
went through in securing the railroads that have contributed so
much to its growth and success. Mention has already been made of
the failure of the Texas &amp; Pacific to reach Fort Worth on schedule
time. A land grant had been given the road by the State conditioned
on its being completed to Fort Worth by the first day of January,
1874. Generous and public Spirited citizens of the city, Maj. K. M.
VanZandt, E. B. Daggett, Thos. J. Jennings and H. G. Hendricks
had donated three hundred and twenty acres of land lying along
the south side of the city upon the same conditions. As each succeeding
legislature met, it extended the time for the construction
of the road for a year, and the grant of lands by the above named
citizens was renewed. This continued until the Constitutional Convention
of 1875, which passed a resolution further extending the time
until the adjournment of the First Legislature held under the new
Constitution.</p>
<p>This session of the Legislature convened on the second Tuesday
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of January, 1876. Tarrant county was represented in that body by
the Hon. Nicholas Darnell, who had also been a member of the Convention
that framed the Constitution. In the meantime the people of
this city despairing of the road being constructed by the company,
undertook to build it themselves. They organized &ldquo;The Tarrant
County Construction Company&rdquo; and subscribed to the capital stock,
assuming to make payment in money, labor, material, forages, supplies
or anything they had which possessed a marketable value.
A contract was entered into with the railway company for the construction
of the road from Eagle Ford, its western terminus, to this
city. The contract was let to Roche Bros. &amp; Tierney, of which firm
J. J. Roche is still surviving and a citizen of the city. The work was
commenced in the fall of 1875. Maj. K. M. VanZandt was the President
of the company, John S. Hirshfield, Vice-President; Zane-Cetti,
Secretary and W. A. Huffman, Treasurer.</p>
<p>When the Legislature assembled, the railway company made
application for still another extension, but the opposition to it was
very pronounced and had a large following. It soon became evident
that a sufficient number of votes could not be secured to obtain the
extension. The company had expended large sums of money in surveying
and platting the lands in the west which amounted to sixteen
sections per mile. It was too rich a prize to abandon without a
struggle. The company took the contract off the hands of The
Construction Company and put forth every energy to the construction
of the road to this place with a view to its completion to this
city before the Legislature should conclude its labors and adjourn.
Gen. John C. Brown, of Tennessee, was the Vice-President of the
company and he was on the ground day and night, if his services
were necessary. Maj. D. W. Washburn, the chief engineer, was equally
active and the contractor, Morgan Jones, is said not to have changed
his clothes or gone regularly to bed during that period of unexampled
activity. The Legislature had finished its labors early in
July and the Senate had passed a concurrent resolution of adjournment
and sent it over to the House. The rails of the Texas &amp; Pacific
were many miles east of Fort Worth. An adjournment of the Legislature
meant the sacrifice of the magnificent landed domain which
it had surveyed and platted. Then commenced the most strenuous
parliamentary battle recorded in the history of this or any other
state. The friends of the railway company refused to adopt the resolution
to adjourn. The vote was so close that the absence of a single
friend of the company might mean disaster. Gen. Darnell, the member
from this county, was one of those who voted against adjournment
and the General was sick. He was carried into the hall every
day, on a cot, and voted &ldquo;no&rdquo; on the resolution to adjourn sine die;
and voted &ldquo;aye&rdquo; on a motion to adjourn till the following day. This
was continued for fifteen days. The rails had reached Sycamore
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
creek just east of the city. Here was a long bridge and a still longer
trestle. The latter has since been filled up. Bridge timbers and
ties were converted into a crib upon which the rails were laid. Then
the track left the grade and took to the dirt road which ran nearly
parallel to the right of way. Ties were laid on the ground supported
at either end by stones picked up from the right of way and
the rails spiked to them. It was as crooked as the proverbial
ram&rsquo;s horn, but it bore up the rails. On the 19th day of July, at
11:23 o&rsquo;clock a. m., the first train ran into Fort Worth. The train
was in charge of Conductor W. R. Bell who still pulls a rope on
the T. &amp; P. and draws a monthly pay check therefrom. Mr. L. S.
Thorne, subsequently Vice-President and General Manager, had
charge of the head brake. Engineer Kelly, the father of Jack Kelly,
who is now the Travelling Engineer of the Fort Worth &amp; Denver, was
at the throttle. The name of the rest of the crew is not obtainable
at this writing.</p>
<p>It was a day of great rejoicing in Fort Worth and the gallant
band who had manifested so much patriotism and faith and worked
so assiduously for the city came into their reward. A great demonstration
was had. Lacking cannon, anvils were obtained from the
shop of W. H. Williams&mdash;for whom E. H. Kellar worked as an apprentice&mdash;Maj.
J. J. Jarvis was chief of artillery with P. J. Bowdry
as his able assistant. Business of every kind became active and the
city commenced to grow and prosper. Buildings of every kind and
character were in great demand and new ones were constructed as
fast as men and money could erect them.</p>
<p>Pending the long wait for the Texas &amp; Pacific other roads had
been chartered and organized. The Fort Worth &amp; Denver City was
the first of these. It was organized August 12th, 1873. Its personnel
came from the active forces of the M. K. &amp; T. and the Texas &amp;
Pacific. The first President was J. M. Eddy, of the &ldquo;Katy.&rdquo; W. W.
H. Lawrence was Vice-President and C. L. Frost, Secretary and
Treasurer. It maintained its organization intact during the period
of depression and was found ready for business when the effects of the
panic were dissipated.</p>
<p>The Red River &amp; Rio Grande from Denison to the Gulf was
chartered as was the Fort Worth, Corsicana &amp; Beaumont. The first
of these was absorbed by the M. K. &amp; T. and the latter was never
given vitality, but later the Fort Worth &amp; New Orleans was organized
and built by Fort Worth people.</p>
<p>M. C. Hurley and J. J. Roche both still living and residents of
the city were active participants in the promotion and construction
of this road. It was later absorbed by the Southern Pacific System,
where the ownership still remains.</p>
<p>The Gulf, Colorado &amp; Santa Fe railway entered Fort Worth on
the second day of December, 1881. In the meantime work had commenced
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
on the Fort Worth &amp; Denver City railway, which was chartered
as early as 1873, and the construction of which was delayed
by the same panic that had wrought such havoc to the fortunes of the
Texas &amp; Pacific. The grading was commenced on this road in
November, 1881, at or near the present station of Hodge. The
first rail was laid the following February and the work was prosecuted
with vigor until the road reached the State line at Texline, where it
met the Denver &amp; New Orleans, which had been constructed from
the City of Denver.</p>
<p>The M. K. &amp; T. came into Fort Worth over the rails of the Trans-Continental
Division of the Texas &amp; Pacific in the early part of 1880.
It continues to use the same line, there being a joint ownership
thereof.</p>
<p>On November 23d, 1886, work was commenced on The Fort
Worth &amp; Rio Grande, a company organized and promoted by the
writer.</p>
<p>In 1887-8 the &ldquo;Cotton Belt&rdquo; made its advent into this city
and in the 90&rsquo;s came the Rock Island, the Frisco and the I. &amp; G. N.
The Trinity &amp; Brazos Valley followed soon after using the Santa
Fe rails between this city and Cleburne and later the Rock Island
between this place and Dallas.</p>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">PUBLIC FREE SCHOOLS.</span></h2>
<p>Many erroneous statements have been made from time to time
about the organization of the Public Free School System of this city.
Credit for this work has been ascribed by different persons to almost
every one that ever had anything to do with the schools, and to
some that never had anything to do with them, except, perhaps what
they were paid to do out of the school funds of the city.</p>
<p>The truth of history makes it necessary to say that credit for
the initial work essential to the organization is due more than to
any one else to Major K. M. VanZandt, Dr. Carroll M. Peak and to
the Fort Worth Democrat.</p>
<p>As early as January, 1877, the Democrat commenced a campaign
for an independent school system in this city. It appealed to the
City Council to order an election to ascertain whether the people
desired to take control of the schools. The necessary resolutions
were passed and an election ordered for the 28th day of February,
with Dr. Peak as presiding officer. The election was held at which
90 votes were cast; 85 for and 5 against the proposition.</p>
<p>When it was proposed to organize, it was contended that a city
of less than 10,000 population could not become an independent
school district. As Fort Worth had less than half this number of
people, the project was abandoned until the early part of 1882. All
during the interim the persons mentioned were working in favor of
the independent schools. It was known that there was opposition
to the special tax for school purposes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>In February, 1882, the Council was again appealed to. This time
to have a special census taken to ascertain if the requisite number
of people lived in Fort Worth to authorize an independent district.
The Council objected to this on account of funds. The writer of
these lines agreed to do the work of supervision and Col. Smith
and Maj. VanZandt furnished the money to pay the enumerators.
The work was done efficiently for the sum of $300.00 and there were
found in Fort Worth 11,136 people. A. E. Want was one of the enumerators
who took this census. An election was then ordered to
levy a special tax to supplement the school fund. Dr. Peak was on
the streets, in season and out of season, urging the tax and it was
approved by a very handsome majority. There were only 35 votes
cast against the proposition, but from the noise made by the opponents,
many more were anticipated.</p>
<p>The first School Trustees were J. J. Jarvis, John Hanna and W.
H. Baldridge. The school opened in October with about 650 pupils.</p>
<p>An advertisement was inserted in the local papers and those in
Saint Louis for a superintendent. There were thirty-two applications
filed and some of the applicants came in person to interview
the trustees. After much deliberation and discussion Prof. Alexander
Hogg, of Marshall, was elected at a salary of $1200 per annum. He
entered upon his duties at the Fall opening of the schools. The following
teachers were selected:</p>
<p>Principals: Mrs. Clara Walden, Miss Sue Huffman and Thos.
Lacey.</p>
<p>First Grade: Miss Jennie Oliver, Emma Hildebrand, Pinka
Jones, Ida Rich and Mrs. M. L. Pearcy.</p>
<p>Second Grade: Miss Bessie Foute, Jennie Howard, R. Madden,
Eva Haywood, Clara Burnham, Maud P. Johnson, Lula Dial and
J. N. Lacey.</p>
<p>There was in the Available School Fund $3,906 and the Board
announced that with the special tax levy a school could be conducted
ten months in the year.</p>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">CHURCHES.</span></h2>
<p>When the writer came to Fort Worth in October, 1872, the only
church edifice in the town was that of the Christian church which
occupied the center of the block bounded by Main and Houston,
Fourth and Fifth streets. It was a small brick structure but of
ample proportions to accommodate the small congregation that worshipped
there. Elder J. A. Clark filled the pulpit.</p>
<p>The Presbyterians had no organization at that time, but one was
perfected early in the year 1873 and there were services once a month
by an evangelist who lived at Waxahachie. Very soon Rev. W. M.
Kilpatrick, who was traveling through North Texas with his family,
in a covered wagon, was called by this denomination and thereafter
it had regular services in a room over Knight&rsquo;s livery stable, which
stood about the corner of Calhoun and Third streets.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>The Methodists worshipped every Sunday morning and evening
at the Court House with Rev. R. R. H. Burnett as pastor.</p>
<p>The Baptists under Rev. J. R. Masters met on the first and second
Sundays at the Masonic building, which stood in the middle of Belknap
street, near the corner of Elm.</p>
<p>The Cumberland Presbyterians held one meeting in the month at
the same place with Rev. W. D. Wear as pastor.</p>
<p>The Catholics met on the last Sunday of the month at the residence
of Mr. Scott, on Main street, Father Parrier being their priest.</p>
<p>On May 15th, 1874, the Methodists commenced the erection of a
place of worship at the corner of Fourth and Grove streets, where
they remained until their present commodious and imposing structure
was erected.</p>
<p>The Baptists started the building of their first church on the
15th day of August, 1874. The building was erected on the grounds
where the City Hall now stands.</p>
<p>In May, 1877, the Presbyterians commenced the erection of a
commodious edifice at the corner of Fourth and Jones streets. B.
B. Paddock, J. P. Alexander, J. M. Hartsfield, S. P. Greene and J. C.
Scott composed the building committee. It was described by a local
writer of the day as &ldquo;handsome and commodious.&rdquo; It must have
been, as its dimensions were 30&times;50 feet and would seat 350 people.</p>
<p>The Episcopalians seem to have left no record that is accessible
of their early work, but it is known that they were here, though in
small numbers. They must have made up in enthusiasm what they
lacked in numbers for it is recorded that on November 23d, 1877,
they purchased a lot at the corner of Rusk at Fifth street for the
fabulous sum of $325.00 and announced that they would proceed to
build a church edifice. They kept the promise. It was occupied
for the first time on the 12th day of February, 1878. It was dedicated
April 15th, 1878. It was reported to have a seating capacity
of 280.</p>
<p>As an evidence of the change that time has wrought in church
matters, it is recorded that the Rev. M. D. Fly tendered his resignation
as pastor of the First Methodist church in September, 1878, giving
as a reason for his action that he could not live on $275.00 per year.
That must have been before W. J. Boaz joined the church and before
George Mulkey made his &ldquo;stake.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">FRATERNITIES.</span></h2>
<p>Fort Worth Lodge, Number 148, A. F. &amp; A. M., is the largest
and wealthiest Masonic lodge in the state. It was constituted April
14th, 1854, &ldquo;Under Dispensation&rdquo; issued by M. W. Grand Master Wm.
M. Taylor on the 18th day of March, 1854, and chartered January
18th, 1855. Julian Feild was the first Worshipful Master and John
Peter Smith its first Secretary. Its first home was a two story
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
brick structure which stood in the middle of Belknap street, at the
intersection of Elm street. The lower story was used for school and
church purposes. The writer of these pages is the Senior Past
Master of the Lodge at this time. W. H. Feild, the present Secretary
has filled that position for about thirty years, the last twenty-five
of which have been consecutive.</p>
<p>There was a small lodge of the I. O. O. F., but no record of its
official roster is accessible to the writer at this time.</p>
<h2 id="c10"><span class="small">KNIGHTS OF PYTHIAS.</span></h2>
<p>The first meeting held to perfect an organization of a Lodge of
Knights of Pythias was on July 23d, 1877.</p>
<p>Queen City Lodge No. 21 was organized August 17th, 1877, with
G. M. Otten, P. C.; T. S. Levy, C. C.; Max Elser, V. C.; Chas.
Gay, M. of A.</p>
<p>Red Cross Lodge No. 14 was organized February 26th, 1881, with
S. Rosenfield, P. C.; W. R. Gause, C. C.; C. K. Fairfax, V. C.; H. P.
Purnell, M. of A.</p>
<p>The lodges at once took up the matter of the erection of a
Castle Hall. Committees were appointed and subscriptions obtained
as far as possible and a bond and mortgage placed on the property
for $12,000, bearing twelve per cent interest.</p>
<p>The corner stone was laid on the sixth day of June, 1881, with
impressive ceremonies under the direction of Supreme Chancellor
Justin H. Rathbone, of Washington City.</p>
<p>The lodges formed in procession at the corner of Fourth and
Main streets and marched to Weatherford street, thence to Houston,
thence to Fourth, thence to Main, thence to Third at the corner of
which the Castle Hall was to be erected.</p>
<p>C. K. Fairfax was the Grand Marshal. Sir Knight Rathbone rode
in a carriage handsomely decorated with the colors of the order
and on either side of the carriage rode two knights in full armor.
These were Knight Louis J. Elser, of Corsicana, and Knight E. M.
Alvord, of Red Cross Lodge.</p>
<p>Arriving at the site the ceremony of laying the corner stone was
had by Knight Justin H. Rathbone. Knight R. E. Beckham of Queen
City Lodge delivered the oration.</p>
<p>The following articles were placed in the corner stone: Roster
of Queen City Lodge; Roster of Red Cross Lodge; Names of Officers
of Supreme Lodge; Names of Officers of the Grand Lodge; Pieces
of gold, silver and paper currency and copies of the papers printed
in the city.</p>
<p>At night an interesting and instructive lecture was delivered by
Knight Rathbone at the Presbyterian church.</p>
<p>Interest on the bonded debt was met promptly and at their
maturity were taken up by a new bond for a much smaller amount
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
at a lower rate of interest. This was the first Castle Hall built in
the World.</p>
<h2 id="c11"><span class="small">WATER WORKS.</span></h2>
<p>The work of supplying the city with water was agitated early
in its history, but nothing definite was accomplished. The necessity
for fire protection was imperative as the city was composed exclusively
of wooden structures. Cisterns were sunk in the streets,
one on Main street between First and Second; one on Houston street
north of Weatherford. These were kept filled from rain water as
far as possible and were guarded with exceeding great care that
the water should not be wasted or diverted from the purpose for
which it was intended. Water for domestic purposes was delivered
by wagon and was obtained from the Clear Fork and from the Cold
Spring on the Trinity, on the Birdville road.</p>
<p>Numerous propositions were submitted to the people at different
times, and varied in cost from $24,600 to $50,000 and provided for
from three quarters of a mile to one mile of pipe line.</p>
<p>It was not until May, 1882, that a franchise was granted by the
city to a company composed of B. B. Paddock, M. B. Loyd, Zane-Cetti,
John D. Templeton and W. P. Wilson for the construction of a
water works system. It provided for about six miles of mains and
forty fire hydrants. Mr. Paddock had enlisted the influence and
interest of the Holly Water Works Company, of Lockhart, New York,
who were represented in Saint Louis by J. S. Drake and M. C. Orton,
who agreed to build the works and install the pumps for a specified
sum. After the franchise was granted it was transferred to a company
composed of Morgan Jones, E. P. Cowen and Henry McLaughlin
who complied with the terms of the franchise and the works were
constructed. They subsequently sold the works to the city.</p>
<p>On August 17th, 1878, Mr. J. J. Peters made the announcement
that artesian water could be found under Fort Worth. He showed
his faith by his works and proceeded to sink a well in the Southwestern
portion of the city, not far from Sixth and Florence streets.
His prediction was verified by a fine flow of water that spouted
many feet above the surface. He proceeded at once to sink a second
well on Peach street, near Hampton, on the property of John
Nichols, which was also a pronounced success. In fact it was a much
stronger flow than that found in the first well. From that time on
there were a number of wells sunk and almost the entire city depended
on the artesian wells for the domestic supply. The history of the
water works system of Fort Worth for later years is known to all
well informed men and need not be elaborated here.</p>
<h2 id="c12"><span class="small">STREET RAILWAYS.</span></h2>
<p>On September 6th, 1876, a franchise was granted to a company
composed of J. P. Smith. K. M. VanZandt, W. A. Huffman, Morgan
Jones and Geo. Noble for a street railway from the court house
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
to the Texas &amp; Pacific depot. The contract for its construction
was let to Morgan Jones and the work commenced on November
17th. The first car ran over the line on Christmas day and Mr.
Walter A. Huffman officiated as conductor. The cars were about
the size of an ordinary street omnibus and were propelled by one
mule something larger than a west Texas jack rabbit. That the
business was not very profitable is gathered from the report of the
first year&rsquo;s business, which shows that the gross receipts were $22.00
per day, showing the transportation of 440 persons each day.</p>
<p>In 1882 there was a spurt in street railway construction that is
probably without a parallel. Every one that had any money, and
some who had none, undertook to build a street railway. The two
most important lines were the Queen City Street Railway and the
Rosedale Street Railway with the road to Mistletoe Heights as a
good third. The latter was constructed from Jennings avenue
out Thirteenth street to Ballinger, thence south across the railway
to Terrell Avenue, or in that neighborhood and thence west under
the Fort Worth &amp; Rio Grande to the Heights. These were where
Westmoreland Place is now located. Then there was the Polytechnic
Heights Street Railway and another across the river and way out
towards Decatur somewhere. The present Traction Company runs
over these two latter, and it owns all that was found of value of the
Rosedale and Queen City lines. Then there was the &ldquo;nine-mile belt&rdquo;
that ran all around over the South Side, crossed the Katy and Santa
Fe tracks on Magnolia Avenue and wandered around through the
Seventh ward somewhere.</p>
<p>Fort Worth was the first city in the United States to have all
of its street railways equipped with electric appliances.</p>
<h2 id="c13"><span class="small">GAS WORKS.</span></h2>
<p>On August 31st, 1876, the first gas company was organized with
J. P. Smith as President; John Nichols, Treasurer and J. Q. St. Clair,
Secretary. A franchise was granted the company. On November 26th.
a contract was entered into with John Lockwood, of New Jersey,
to construct the works and lay the mains. Some idea of the extent
of the plant can be gathered from the fact that it was to cost
$20,000. The plant was added to from time to time, as the demand
for light increased, until the entire business section was supplied
with gas. The works were finally sold to a new company of which
Mr. H. C. Scott, of St. Louis, was the principal owner, and it remained
under his control until sold to the Fort Worth Light &amp; Power Co.,
and it in turn transferred the property to the present company.</p>
<h2 id="c14"><span class="small">PACKING HOUSES.</span></h2>
<p>It would be a harrowing tale to relate all the efforts made to
provide a packing plant for this city. The Fort Worth Democrat,
which had earned a reputation for &ldquo;seeing things,&rdquo; first made the
prediction on April 25th, 1875, that some day Fort Worth would be
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
a large producer of refrigerated meats for export. It harped on
this in season and out of season and watched for every opportunity
to advance the project. The editor, learning that a man was in
Dallas negotiating to establish a plant there, went to that city and
formed his acquaintance. It was learned that the Dallas people
did not regard the project with much favor. The man, whose name
was Richardson only asked that the city make a donation of six
acres of ground for the plant. He was told that if he would come to
Fort Worth that he could select the ground and that a deed would be
delivered to him in an hour. He came and looked over the situation
and selected the lands where the Medlin Mill now stands. Fortunately
the land belonged to John Peter Smith and it was only necessary
to tell Smith what was in the wind and the deed was forthcoming.
He erected a small packing plant on the land now occupied by the
Medlin Flouring Mills. As he only essayed to kill and refrigerate
hogs, and as there were very few hogs in Texas, the plant was
shortlived. He soon sold it and went out about Cisco and put in
a plant to make plaster from gypsum.</p>
<p>Shortly after this a man by the name of Higgs came to the
city and in a few days secured capital to erect a refrigerating plant
in the southeast part of the city. He killed a cargo of cattle and
sent them to Saint Louis, but that proved like sending coals to Newcastle
and his venture was doomed to failure. He sold his plant
to Mr. Isaac Dahlman of the firm of Dahlman Bros., the first
clothing merchants in the city. He killed cattle and sent them to
Liverpool by way of Galveston, but they were so long on the way
that they did not arrive in good condition. This ended the third
attempt but did not dismay the people of Fort Worth. They believed
that this was to become a packing house center and in 1890
thirty men got together and each agreed to put in one thousand
dollars and purchase some lands and put up more money, share and
share alike, as it was needed. Mr. H. C. Holloway was selected
to manage the affairs of the company and he bought lands where
the present plants are situated and proceeded to build fences and
lots and later on a small packing house. It had a capacity of 250
cattle and 1000 hogs per day. About this time John R. Hoxie came to
Fort Worth from Chicago and as it was thought he knew all about
the industry, he was induced to put in more money, buy more land
and increase the capacity of the yards.</p>
<p>He too made a failure and the plant after a precarious existence
was sold to Messrs. Simpson and Niles of Boston, neither of whom
were practical packers. Mr. Niles was a business man and under his
management with the assistance of Mr. H. A. Judd, still a citizen of
Fort Worth, the plant earned money. The owners recognized the fact
that the plant did not meet the requirements of the times and with the
assistance of some of the public spirited people of the city they enlisted
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
the interest of Armour and Swift and secured the present establishments.
Most of the thirty men who put the first money into the
plant surrendered their holdings as gifts to make the deal go through.</p>
<p>The corner stone of the new buildings was laid on the 13th day of
March, 1902, in the presence of a large concourse of the citizens
of the city. Just a year thereafter the first cattle were killed in
the new houses. At that time Mr. Armour made the prediction that
in ten years Fort Worth would be the second market for cattle
in the United States. His prediction was verified.</p>
<h2 id="c15"><span class="small">FIRE DEPARTMENT.</span></h2>
<p>The first attempt to organize a fire company in the city occurred
in April, 1873. A meeting for that purpose was called at the
court house by the Democrat. When the night arrived it brought
with it a &ldquo;blue norther.&rdquo; There was not sufficient interest in the
matter to justify the people in facing the storm and the only person
present was the editor of the paper. The following is his report of the
meeting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pursuant to notice given in the last number of the Democrat,
we proceeded to the court house last Tuesday evening at precisely
half past seven, to meet the citizens in mass meeting, for the purpose
of becoming a member of the Fort Worth Hook and Ladder
Company No. 1. We took our position on the steps of that edifice,
and although the stone was a little cool, we heroically held our position
until patience ceased to be a virtue. Not a soul put in an
appearance. Several who had promised faithfully to be present forgot
to keep the appointment.</p>
<p>Determined to carry to a successful completion every project we
take in hand, we went to work to organize the meeting. A chairman
is essential to any meeting. They are necessary to keep the meeting
in order, and give the assemblage proper dignity. We were unanimously
chosen chairman and took our seat amid the most profound
silence. But a difficulty, wholly unexpected now presented itself. A
secretary to keep the record of the proceedings is equally indispensable.
There was no one to make secretary. Not to be thwarted
by minor obstacles, we finally with much reluctance, consented
to assume this arduous position also. Some one was needed to manage
the finances and take care of the funds. That being our forte,
we assumed the responsible position of treasurer. We then appointed
ourself a committee of five to draft resolutions. The resolutions
agreeably to an ancient custom at meetings of this kind had been
prepared by a friend. We immediately proceeded to adopt them as
a whole without debate.</p>
<p>We have procured all the machinery necessary for a first class
Hook and Ladder company, viz: a five foot step ladder, a walking
stick with a hook on the end, a pint cup and a wet blanket and are
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
now ready to extinguish fire in any part of the city on short notice.
All orders promptly executed, day or night.</p>
<p>Dallas can no longer claim to be ahead of Fort Worth. The
Herald and News are complaining because they have no fire brigade.
Send your orders to Fort Worth, neighbor. If you will let us know
a day or two before you intend to have a fire, we will be on hand
with our machine.</p>
<p>We are going to give a ba(w)ll pretty soon for the relief of
the sufferers by the first fire. Of course we are going to have a
fire or there would be no necessity for our Hook and Ladder company,
and when there is a fire, of course some one will suffer. Then
you will know how it is yourself, dear people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A second attempt made about a month later was more successful.
A goodly number answered the call and a company was organized
with Capt. S. P. Greene as President, B. B. Paddock, Secretary and
William T. Field as Foreman. There were about sixty members,
mostly clerks and mechanics, on the roll and they made up a purse
and ordered a hook and ladder truck with all the necessary accoutrements.
A series of entertainments were given to raise the funds at
one of which a vote was taken at so much per vote for the most
popular young lady in the city, who should have the privilege of
naming the company. The leading contestants were Miss Sallie
Johnson, daughter of Col. M. T. Johnson and Miss Anna T. Harper,
a sister of Mrs. B. B. Paddock. Miss Johnson was the successful
candidate and the company was named in honor of her father the
M. T. Johnson Hook and Ladder Company. It remained as No. 1
until 1893, when the paid fire department was organized, when it
passed off the stage. There was never a more enthusiastic and successful
band of fire-fighters.</p>
<p>On October 17th, 1876, when city airs were assumed, an engine
company was organized, of which Capt. M. B. Loyd was president. He
was also the first president of the Fort Worth Fire Department, which
was organized after the second company came into existence, and was
the accredited delegate to the meeting of the State Fire Department.
Other companies followed as the necessity arose and Fort Worth
long enjoyed the reputation of having the finest department in the
State. When the city took over the management of the fire department
and put the men on the payroll, the volunteers were given
preference over all applicants and some of them are in service at
this writing. When it became a paid fire department, Mr. N. H.
Lassiter was the President, and the last meeting was a most affecting
occasion. Many of the old &ldquo;fire-fighters&rdquo; were opposed
to disbanding the volunteer service and laid down the responsibility
with great reluctance.</p>

<p class="t0">As swept the hunt through Campus-more.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It would be an almost endless task and one the writer will
not essay to tell the history of the newspapers of this city. It has
been the graveyard of the hopes and aspirations of ambitious men,
who without capital, and oft times without experience, have undertaken
the work of furnishing an unappreciative public with a newspaper
in Fort Worth.</p>
<p>It was on March 7th, 1860, that Fort Worth had its first paper.
It was started by a man by the name of Cleveland and was called
the Enterprise. How long it continued, and what became of it
the writer has been unable the ascertain.</p>
<p>The second attempt was made in October, 1871, when Maj. K.
M. VanZandt, John Hanna, W. H. Overton, Capt. Sam Evans and
Junius W. Smith bought from Maj. J. J. Jarvis the press and material
of a paper at Quitman in Wood county and moved here and started
the Fort Worth Democrat. In October, 1872, they sold it to Capt. B.
B. Paddock, who assumed management and direction of the paper on
the 1st day of January, 1873. He continued the publication until June
30th, 1882, when it was merged with the Live Stock Journal, owned
by George B. Loving, and changed to the Fort Worth Gazette, which
during its continuance was confessedly the best paper ever printed
in this State.</p>
<p>On July 4th, 1876, the Democrat started the first daily paper,
coming out as a morning paper on the morning of the Centennial
year, unannounced and unheralded, without a single subscriber or a line
of advertising. The audacity of the enterprise made a favorable
impression on the public-spirited and generous people of the city and
they rallied to its support with enthusiasm. But there was neither
room nor patronage for a daily morning paper in a city of three
thousand people and the patronage, however liberal, would not
furnish it with the necessary nourishment and it was a failure
financially from start to finish. It was a wide awake and enterprising
little sheet, advocating with zeal and enthusiasm every measure
that its owner considered for the upbuilding of the city.</p>
<p>In 1873 the Fort Worth Standard made its bow to the public. It
was owned and managed by Mr. J. K. Millican who is still a resident
of the city. It was followed during the same summer by the
Epitomist, established by Will H. Lawrence, who came from Kansas.
The panic of 1873 sent it to the happy hunting grounds. On its
demise the associate editor, L. R. Brown, better known at that time
as &ldquo;High-toned Brown&rdquo; leased the material and started The Post,
which lasted about three weeks. The public realized that there
was not room for two papers, much less three, and failed to accord
it any patronage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>The Standard lasted for several years. Soon after the Democrat
started its daily, the Standard essayed the same, publishing an
evening paper. But it could not find the necessary support and
finally succumbed to the inevitable.</p>
<p>The Journal, Mirror, Star, Mail, Tribune, News and many other
papers came and went down in the years that followed with rapid succession.
The experience of one seemed to have no effect on the ambitions
of the men who knew how to run a paper.</p>
<p>In the Spring of 1884 Capt. Paddock sold his interest in the
Gazette to Mr. Loving and retired from active newspaper work, although
he was interested several times in the property in a financial
way.</p>
<p>In 1885 the Gazette was purchased by a stock company organized
for that purpose by Maj. VanZandt, Walter Huffman, Morgan Jones,
W. G. Turner, W. L. Malone, B. B. Paddock and others who wanted
to have a good morning paper in the city. The ownership finally
passed into the hands of Mr. W. A. Huffman, who during his lifetime
kept it up at great financial sacrifice and loss. But its high standard
never faltered. It was a good paper published every day in the week.
After the lamentable death of Mr. Huffman, his widow essayed to
continue the publication of the paper. It was still conducted at
great financial loss. After the panic of 1893, Mrs. Huffman realized
that she could no longer stand the strain incident to its publication
and she sold the paper to Capt. B. B. Paddock. He had neither
desire nor ambition to continue in the business and was only actuated
by a wish that the paper should not suspend. He proceeded to
organize a stock company to take over the property. He associated
Mr. W. L. Malone, then out of business, Mr. E. G. Senter, who was
publishing an afternoon paper called the Mail, Hon. Barnett Gibbs,
Mr. Sawnee Robinson, Mr. O. B. Colquitt and some others and
turned the plant over to them. It proved not to be a very happy
family. With the most harmonious effort its success was not a
certainty; with discord in the management, it was doomed to disaster.
Mr. Paddock transferred his interest to Mr. Malone in order to give
him control, hoping thereby to bring about a solution of the trouble.
Soon thereafter Mr. Malone died and with his death the paper was
doomed. Mr. Senter had associated with him his cousin Selden
Williams, who came from Tennessee, to engage in the business.
They could not make it a success. In the late summer of 1897 they
sold the Associated Press franchise and the subscription list to the
Dallas News and suspended publication without a word of warning
to the people of the city. It was the most dastardly piece of disloyalty
to a town ever perpetrated.</p>
<p>For a long time thereafter Fort Worth was without an organ
or an advocate in the way of a daily newspaper. It felt the loss
keenly, but there was no one to step into the breach and assume the
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
responsibility of the publication of a paper. There had been such
a fatality attending every effort that men hesitated to put their
money into another venture. A man by the name of King finally
came along and proposed on certain conditions to start a morning
paper. The people wanted a paper so much that the conditions
were eagerly accepted and Mr. King started the Herald. It lasted
about a month. The promoter pocketed the money that had been
advanced him and hied himself to new and fresher pastures. Thus
the second time the public were betrayed.</p>
<p>When the Gazette was sold to the News it left a large number
of men out of employment. They proceeded to organize a co-operative
company and publish the Register. They got what business
they could at whatever price they could obtain and on Saturday night
divided the proceeds among the working force. Among these interested
were A. J. Sandegard, J. A. McAllister and Clarence Lee who
are still among the honored citizens of the city. The Register grew
rapidly in business and favor. The public applauded the nerve of
the promoters and gave it such liberal patronage that it had money in
the bank&mdash;the first time such a thing had happened to a Fort Worth
paper. It was finally merged into the Fort Worth Record, which
has also been a paying enterprise.</p>
<p>The history of the Star-Telegram, another successful newspaper
venture is too recent and too well known to require extended notice
in this paper.</p>
<h2 id="c17"><span class="small">HOTELS.</span></h2>
<p>The advent of the railroad created a demand for increased hotel
facilities and the public-spirited citizens proceeded to supply the
demand. On December 1st, 1876, a company was organized with a
capital of $30,000 of which Capt. J. C. Terrell was elected President;
W. J. Boaz, Vice-President; J. Q. Sandidge, Treasurer and C. K.
Fairfax, Secretary. K. M. VanZandt, W. A. Huffman, W. W. Dunn,
J. C. Terrell, J. Q. Sandidge, B. C. Evans, J. E. Streeper, C. K.
Fairfax and W. J. Boaz constituted the Board of Directors. It was
christened the El Paso Hotel and was opened for business on the
22d day of September, 1877, with seventy-six rooms. It was leased
to C. K. Fairfax &amp; Co., who furnished it at a cost of approximately
$15,000. It was located where the present Westbrook now stands.
Major VanZandt and his family may not like to have it told that he
was subjected to no little criticism at the time by some of the people
for his action in this connection, but the truth of history requires
that personal feelings must not stand in the way of telling the truth
about such matters. Major VanZandt owned the land on which it
was desired to erect the building and it was asserted that knowing
this to be the logical place for the hotel, that he held the company up
for an exorbitant price. He put the half block at the fabulous sum
of three thousand dollars, payable in stock of the company. It would
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
be interesting to know what the &ldquo;kickers&rdquo; if any of them are alive
now think of the objections. The Major finally got forty cents on
the dollar for his stock which made the price of the half block $1200.
The property was finally sold to M. C. Hurley, but the price paid is
not available at this writing.</p>
<p>Other hostelries at that time were the Mansion, Clark House,
Commercial Hotel and other less pretentious houses, every one of
which was &ldquo;the best in the city.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small">STAGE LINES.</span></h2>
<p>Prior to 1880, all the passenger business and transportation of
the mails for the entire country west of Fort Worth was conducted
by stage lines, which radiated from the city as the railroads do now.</p>
<p>The first line of importance and one that attracted the attention
of the entire country was the Fort Worth and Fort Concho stage
line which ran a daily line from this city to Fort Concho which stood
where San Angelo is now located. This was what was known
in postoffice parlance as &ldquo;star route&rdquo; service.</p>
<p>In 1877 a contract was let by the Post Office Department for a
daily line from Fort Worth to Fort Yuma, Arizona, a distance of
1560 miles, the longest stage line in the world. Fort Worth shouted
itself hoarse when the announcement was made and a banquet was
given the manager of the line, Mr. J. T. Chidester. Bob McCart
who had but recently come to the city from Bloomington, Illinois,
was the principal speaker on the occasion and one who heard his
speech must have been impressed with the fact that this was the
greatest commercial enterprise in all history, up to that time. The
stages were run through to Yuma in seventeen days. But this was
found to be too long. The coyotes and horned frogs that inhabited
most of the country beyond the Concho could not afford to wait
that long for their mail and so the Second Assistant Postmaster
General, at the earnest solicitation of the inhabitants, and the contractors,
agreed to increase the compensation one hundred per cent.
if the trip could be made in thirteen days&mdash;which was easy. It was
one of the matters for Congressional investigation of the &ldquo;Star Route
Steal&rdquo; but they never found Chidester. The mail left Fort Worth
in a concord coach pulled by six horses and ran to Tharp Springs,
where it was transferred to a surrey with two horses. These went
as far as Brownwood, where a buckboard and two bronchos took it
the remainder of the way, if they were not interrupted.</p>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small">THE COURTS.</span></h2>
<p>At that time the Judicial District in which Tarrant county was a
part included the counties of Denton, Parker, Wise and Dallas. Hon.
Hardin Hart was District Judge. He was an appointee of Edward
J. Davis and was not very popular with the bar or the people. He
was about as rough a specimen of the genus homo as ever graced
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
the bench. His habits were said not to be very exemplary and this
contributed to his unpopularity. He was accustomed to use the
vernacular of the bar-room and the poker game. At one time J. C.
Terrell proposed to amend his pleadings and the Judge responded,
&ldquo;Now, Joe, you know you can&rsquo;t raise at this stage of the game. Gause
stands pat on his general denial and you will have to call or lay
down your hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not hold in very high regard the rules of the Higher Courts
or their decisions. On one occasion when James H. Field was arguing
a case, the Judge interrupted him and proceeded to render an
adverse decision. Field, opening a law book said, &ldquo;If your Honor
please, the Supreme Court says&rdquo;; Field was not permitted to tell
the bench what the Supreme Court said. Interrupting him, the Judge
announced, &ldquo;Well, let the Supreme Court say it agin, if it wants to.&rdquo;
It was stated that his rulings were usually correct, notwithstanding
his manner of delivering them.</p>
<p>At the March term, 1873, of the District Court, C. C. Cummings,
B. B. Paddock and Mr. Albritton were admitted to the bar. The
latter was easily the brightest and best of these, but he could not
stand the pressure of the hard times that soon set in and left the
city, going to San Diego. Cummings and Paddock are the only surviving
members of the bar at that time. Major J. J. Jarvis is a
close second, he having come to this city in April and formed a
partnership with John Peter Smith.</p>
<h2 id="c20"><span class="small">POSTAL MATTERS.</span></h2>
<p>The Postoffice was conducted by Rev. J. A. Clark in the early
part of the year, but he resigned and P. J. Bowdry was, after a
spirited contest, appointed to succeed him. Mr. Clark kept what
there was of the postoffice in the drug store of W. T. Ferguson.
There was but little order and decorum in its management, as the
postmaster was anxious to be relieved of his duties. It was not
uncommon for the people to go behind the counter and help themselves
to their mail. Bowdry held the office until July, 1874, when
President Grant removed him to make a place for Col. A. G. Malloy,
of Tyler, who was of the same political faith. Malloy held the office
but a short time. In November he was appointed Collector of
Customs at Jefferson and he left at once. Bowdry, who had been
his deputy, was left in charge of the office. An effort was made
to have L. M. Barkley, the present Postmaster, appointed. His
father, J. A. Barkley, constituted the Republican party of Tarrant
county at that time, but his pull at Washington was not sufficient to
secure the appointment for his son and J. P. Alexander was appointed.
He raised a howl of protest at the very outset by moving the office
to the corner of Main and Third streets which was at that time
&ldquo;way out in the country.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<h2 id="c21"><span class="small">BANKS.</span></h2>
<p>The first bank opened in Fort Worth was the banking house
of Tidball &amp; Wilson. Tidball came to the city early in January,
1873, from St. Charles, Missouri. Associated with him was John F.
Wilson, of Virginia. Wilson furnished the money and Tidball the
experience. George B. Hendricks was the sole employe of the bank.
Tidball and he constituted the entire force. In August, 1874, Maj.
K. M. VanZandt, J. P. Smith and J. J. Jarvis bought the interest
of Wilson and put in some more money and the firm became Tidball,
VanZandt &amp; Co. and so remained until 1877, when it was merged
into the Fort Worth National Bank. The second bank was that
of Loyd, Marklee &amp; Co., consisting of M. B. Loyd, Jer. Marklee and
John Nichols. This continued but a few months when Loyd sold
his interest to W. J. Boaz and the bank became Boaz, Marklee &amp; Co.,
which was in turn succeeded by the City National Bank. In the
summer of 1873, the bank of G. VanWinkle &amp; Co. was opened. It
was composed of G. VanWinkle and A. P. Wroten. It was short
lived. The panic of 1873 closed its doors. After disposing of his
interest in the bank of Loyd, Marklee &amp; Co. Capt. Loyd proceeded
to the organization of the First National Bank, of which he was made
President and so continued until his death in April, 1912. D. C.
Bennett was the First Vice-President and C. H. Higbee, Cashier. Of
the directors Zane-Cetti and S. B. Burnett remain at this writing.</p>
<p>The situation remained unchanged until the year 1882, when Capt.
H. C. Edrington came to Fort Worth from Bryan and established
the Traders National Bank, of which he was President and W. J.
Boaz, Vices-President and George Mulkey, Cashier.</p>
<p>In October, 1876, McCrary &amp; Barlow opened a private bank.
The firm consisted of John E. Barlow and Nelson McCrary. Barlow
has been dead many years but McCrary still live a worthy citizen
of this city.</p>
<h2 id="c22"><span class="small">TEXAS SPRING PALACE.</span></h2>
<p>This unique and attractive place of amusement came at a date
within the memory of thousands now living, but it was such an
unusual and beautiful edifice that a few lines in regard to it may
not be inappropriate.</p>
<p>It was erected in the Winter and Spring of 1888-9, and was located
on the Texas &amp; Pacific reservation north of and opposite the intersection
of Railroad and Galveston avenues.</p>
<p>At that time Toronto, Canada, and Saint Paul, Minn. were having
Ice Palaces and Sioux City, Iowa, its Corn Palace. General R. A.
Cameron who was the Colonization and Immigration Agent of the
Fort Worth &amp; Denver, conceived the idea of having such an exhibition
of the products of the Field, Forest, Orchard and Garden
at Fort Worth and having it in the spring when there were no
other places of entertainment and amusement anywhere in the
country.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>A company was soon organized with a capital of $50,000 of which
$38,000 was subscribed when the company commenced business.
B. B. Paddock was made President, W. A. Huffman, Treasurer and
Willis H. Post, Secretary. W. F. Sommerville was made Director
General and Gen. Cameron his assistant.</p>
<p>The contract for the building which was in the shape of a Saint
Andrew&rsquo;s cross and was 225x375 feet in dimensions was let to
Thos. J. Hurley and his associates, who were then in the business
of constructing buildings. E. D. Allen, of Chicago, was employed
to superintend the decorations. There was not an inch of timber
in the structure, except the floors, but that was covered with some
product of Texas, wrought in the most artistic manner into pictures.
It was easily the most beautiful structure ever erected on earth. It
was opened May 10th, 1889, with impressive ceremonies and everybody
in town was present. Governor Thurston, of Nebraska, made the
opening address and the music was furnished by the band of the
Elgin Watch Factory, of Elgin, Illinois. The National Band of
Mexico and other bands from different sections of the country were
in attendance during the season.</p>
<p>No expense or pains were spared in advertising the Palace in all
parts of the country. Special committees, travelling in &ldquo;special cars&rdquo;
were sent to Washington and to the City of Mexico to present invitations
to Presidents Harrison and Diaz of the two Republics to
attend the Spring Palace. These invitations were the limit of the
engraver&rsquo;s art and were handsomely bound in silver. This is but a
sample of the extravagant management that attended the work
from start to finish. The result was, that notwithstanding the generous
patronage of the home people and the public when the gates
were closed on the 10th day of June, there was a deficit of over
$23,000. It took President Paddock and the Directors about an hour
to raise the money and pay off the bills of the company.</p>
<p>In January, 1900, the Directors for the second year opened subscription
lists for the money for the second year. It was soon subscribed
and the work inaugurated for the second year. More economical
plans were adopted and more system observed in the expenditure
of funds. One hundred feet were added to the east and
west wings of the building and the decorations were as elaborate
and beautiful as for the first year. One hundred of the patriotic
women of the city were organized into groups of ten each and they
worked eight and ten hours a day for over one hundred days in decorating
the building. Such another example of patriotic purpose
was never before seen in any community.</p>
<p>The building when completed was as beautiful and more elaborate
than the first. Cities and counties from all over the State were
assigned space in the building and prizes offered for the most attractive
decoration. This enlisted the interest of many towns and
counties and the result was very gratifying.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>The attendance for the second year exceeded that of the first,
as the beauty and attractiveness as well as the utility of the exhibit
had been heralded over the State and adjoining States. The season
was most profitable and successful from every standpoint.</p>
<p>The last night but one was dedicated to a grand fancy dress
ball to be held on the ground floor of the building which had a
space for dancing of approximately 16,000 square feet. A most extensive
ball room. Special trains were run from near-by cities and
towns; that from Dallas bringing over one thousand people in their
best &ldquo;bib and tucker.&rdquo; But they were destined not to enjoy the
occasion. Just as the floor had been cleared and the visitors were
entering the gates the cry of &ldquo;Fire! Fire!! Fire!!!&rdquo; rang through the
building, carrying terror to every inmate of the vast structure. How
the fire originated was never determined. It started on the north
side, about the center of the Main Building, and in less time than
it takes to write these lines, the entire structure was a mass of flames,
inside and out. It was estimated that there were 7000 people in the
building and why hundreds did not perish is a mystery. The officials
of the company, who were present, directed the visitors to the various
exits, of which there were sixteen, and no Sunday school in the
country was ever dismissed with more decorum and good order.
Every person accepted the direction of those in charge as if they
were on dress parade on a military plaza. In four minutes the
building was a mass of flame, inside and out, and in eleven minutes
the building fell to the ground. So rapid was the spread of the fire,
that the firemen, who were stationed in different parts of the building
with their hose connected to the fire hydrants, did not have
time to turn on the water.</p>
<p>That the loss of life was not appalling is one of the wonders
of the occasion. About thirty people were injured, more or less
seriously, and many were burned. Low necked and short sleeved
dresses of the ladies exposed them to the falling cinders and pieces
from the decorations which were of the lightest and most inflammable
character.</p>
<p>One life only was sacrificed, that of Al Haynes, a civil engineer,
who was one of the most active and efficient in directing the moving
throngs to the various exits and rendering assistance to the people.
He seemed to be as cool and collected as any person in the building.
But he seemed to have lost self-control at the last minute and ran
and jumped through a window to the ground below, a distance of
seventeen feet. The fall broke both ankles and prevented him
from getting away from the fire which was raging over that part of
the exterior. Some gallant men took the &ldquo;fly&rdquo; from a tent that stood
in the garden and holding it before them rushed up and threw it over
Haynes and then dragged him away from the building. The most
conspicuous man in this was a workman, named Mahoney, who was
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
badly burned. Haynes was removed to the hospital and received
the best medical treatment that could be obtained, but he succumbed
to the injuries received, the following day.</p>
<p>The ladies of the city, under the leadership of Mrs. Drew Pruitt,
now of Los Angeles, solicited the funds and erected the monument
to his memory that now stands in the triangle at the foot of Main
and Houston streets.</p>
<p>The Spring Palace, which was a credit to the public spirit of the
people of Fort Worth, went out in a blaze of glory.</p>
<h2 id="c23"><span class="small">TELEGRAPH LINES.</span></h2>
<p>The first telegraph line was built into Fort Worth in the summer
of 1876. It was owned and operated by C. L. Frost and Max
Elser. After the advent of the Railroad it was sold to the Western
Union. In 1886 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Telegraph Company built into
the city, but it soon sold to the Western Union.</p>
<h2 id="c24"><span class="small">FLOURING MILLS.</span></h2>
<p>The first flouring mill for commercial purposes was built by
Messrs. Wolcott &amp; Blandin. Work commenced on November 28th,
1874, and the first flour was ground June 26th, 1875. Later Joseph
H. Brown bought an interest in the mill and secured the expert services
of James W. Swayne as manager. Swayne, who was called
&ldquo;Jim&rdquo; by his friends, was educated for the law and of course knew
all about the manufacture and sale of flour. The second mill was
built by Mr. M. P. Bewley, whose worthy son, E. E. Bewley is at
this writing the manager of the Medlin Mills.</p>
<h2 id="c25"><span class="small">REGISTERED CATTLE.</span></h2>
<p>The first registered cattle were brought to Texas from London,
Ohio, by James A. Brock, then of Fort Griffin, now of El Paso. It
was thought at that time to be a foolish venture, but time and experience
has demonstrated his wisdom.</p>
<h2 id="c26"><span class="small">LUMBER YARDS.</span></h2>
<p>Following the completion of the railroad to Fort Worth came
lumber yards and lumber dealers from all over East Texas. All
that section of the city bounded by Houston street, Monroe street, on
the east and west and by Ninth street on the north and as far south
as the railroad reservation, was one vast lumber yard; and the entire
country west, southwest and northwest of Fort Worth was supplied
with building material from this city. Hundreds of wagons were
loaded daily and the roads out of Fort Worth were lined with wagons
transporting it to as far west as San Angelo and even beyond. It was
the nearest market for all the western country for several years
and brought millions of dollars to the city.</p>
<p>The first cotton compress was erected by Col. E. W. Morton,
about the foot of Commerce street. The first bale of cotton was
compressed on the 17th day of September, 1877, with appropriate
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
ceremonies. On September 2d, 1878, a second compress was erected.</p>
<p>The first grain elevator was erected by Mark Evans about where
the present depot of the Fort Worth &amp; Denver road now stands.</p>
<p>The first ice factory was built by R. E. Maddox, W. H. Little
and Dr. N. Wallerich, they having acquired the plant of the first
refrigerator and converted it into an ice factory.</p>
<h2 id="c27"><span class="small">EFFORTS AT UPLIFT.</span></h2>
<p>The reformer was here then as now and tried to reform every
one else but himself, just as they do now and with about the
same success. The town was &ldquo;wide open&rdquo; to the horror of some
and an effort was made at intervals to put a stop to the open
gambling house. One Grand Jury falling under the influence of
the &ldquo;up-lifters&rdquo; brought out indictments against about thirty members
of a whist club that played whist in the rear of a saloon owned and
managed by Henry Byrne. (His widow, Maggie, lives here still.)
The club was composed of the business men of the city; not one of
whom ever entered the wide open gambling houses. Having no business,
they played whist. The stakes were a bottle of beer&mdash;if any
one wanted the beer. A dozen or more indictments were found
against each member. The District Attorney was a Dallas lawyer.
The fee in each case was ten dollars. A pretty good sum for one
term of Court. The juries were compelled to find verdicts of guilty
and assessed the fine at from 1/37 of a cent up to one cent. But it
carried the costs. The county paid many hundreds of dollars for
the fun and the district attorney gathered many thousands. He was
not a candidate for re-election.</p>
<h2 id="c28"><span class="small">OH! THE FUN WE HAD.</span></h2>
<p>There was lots of fun in those days. No one had much to do
but to enjoy life and boost Fort Worth. They did both to the extreme
limit. A man could and did wear the same suit of clothes year
after year and no one commented on his frugality or poverty. Women
wore the same dresses to church, Sunday after Sunday, and no one
was found to criticise. The girls, and there were pretty girls then
as now, not so plentiful, only because there were not so many girls,
wore the same dresses (that was before they commenced wearing
&ldquo;gowns&rdquo; in the daytime) to all society gatherings without apology
or explanation.</p>
<p>They did not find it necessary to cut their dresses for high water
or low in the neck in order to display their physical charms. There
were dances in the court room, in a hall over a livery stable and
at private residences, occasionally. They danced the cotillion, lancers,
Virginia reel. The tango, bunny hug, turkey trot and other fancy
stunts were unknown.</p>
<p>There were picnics on the Clear Fork in the daytime and by
moonlight, when the moon was in commission. Everybody was happy
and tried to make his neighbor happy. Good old days.</p>
<p>The practical joker had plenty of time in which to indulge in
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
his fun. One of the best of these was on General Peers, who kept
the Commercial Hotel, at the corner of Fifth and Commerce streets.
As usual, every one was on the qui vive for railroad news. One day
John S. Hirshfield had a spurious telegram delivered to the General,
purporting to be from the private secretary of Jay Gould, the then
president of the Texas &amp; Pacific, announcing that Mr. Gould and a
party of capitalists would arrive on the stage that afternoon and
asking that provision be made for their entertainment. It was signed
by &ldquo;Tom Collins,&rdquo; at that day the cognomen for all imaginary and
fictitious persons. But the General did not know this and proceeded
to buy up all the turkeys in the market and all the other delicacies
to be had. He was instigated to invite about fifty of the more prominent
citizens to dine with Mr. Gould. The plan was for each of the
invited guests to pay for his dinner so that the hotel would suffer no
loss. Along in the afternoon, Charles Fallbush, who traveled for
the wholesale liquor house of Day &amp; Co. came in from a western
trip, dusty and travel stained and was introduced to General Peers,
as Tom Collins, the Secretary of Mr. Gould. Fallbush explained
that he had driven over from Dallas ahead of the party to see that all
arrangements were made for the entertainment of his chief. The
scheme was working beautifully until &ldquo;Tuck&rdquo; Boaz, not being advised
that the invited guests were to pay for the dinner and not
wishing the General to suffer such a loss gave the game away.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;tender-foot&rdquo; was an easy mark for the practical joker and
many of the &ldquo;tales that were told&rdquo; about the condition of affairs in
Texas were the result of the jests played on men unused to the customs
of Texas. On one occasion a man by the name of Robinson,
who traveled for the Hall Safe and Lock Co., badgered his friends
about being afraid of Indians. At that time there was not an Indian in
Texas, but, of course, he did not know that. He was persuaded by
some of the traveling men who then made the western territory to
accompany him on a trip out west. The man consented and went
as far as Comanche. They laid over there on Sunday and the stranger
was regaled all the day with stories of the hair-breadth escapes that
members of the party at the hotel had made in the recent past.
The &ldquo;tender-foot&rdquo; was not afraid of Indians. About the middle of
the afternoon the party dissolved, one at a time until only the stranger
and the drummer he was with were left in the hotel. Then a suggestion
was made that they two take a walk up the banks of Indian
Creek, which runs by the town. He was glad to go. Was not
afraid of Indians. Oh no. About half a mile from town those who
had gone ahead suddenly rushed out of the mesquite firing their pistols
and yelling like mad. The stranger was told to run for his life&mdash;and
he did. His companion soon fell to the ground calling on him to
run. He ran into town and under the hotel. The Democrat published
a column or two about the event and sold Robinson one hundred and
fifty copies at ten cents per. He mailed them to every one of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
acquaintance east of the Mississippi and was a hero, until the next
issue told the truth about the event. He did not order any extra
copies of that issue.</p>
<p>These are sample bricks of what was going on most of the time,
and will suffice to indicate that life was not a burden to those who
were waiting for something to turn up, and who knew how to enjoy
their enforced idleness.</p>
<h2 id="c29"><span class="small">STEALING AN EXCURSION.</span></h2>
<p>One of the most amusing incidents of the time occurred in the
Spring of 1875. A man by the name of George W. Cole from somewhere
up in Pennsylvania had plotted a townsite out in Palo Pinto
County which he called Lamar. He alleged in his advertisements that
it would be a division point on the Texas &amp; Pacific. He sold a good
many lots to the &ldquo;sucker&rdquo; element that is always ready to grab at any
thing that sounds cheap. He went over to Tennessee and worked
up an excursion to come and see Texas. It was farthest from his
thought to show them Lamar. He only intended to let them see
what a good country Texas was. Hearing about the excursion, the
Democrat got out an extra edition, telling about Tarrant county in
general and Fort Worth in particular. The editor took a bundle of
the papers and went to Texarkana to meet the excursion train. It
took breakfast at that place and while the excursionists were enjoying
their mututinal meal, the papers were distributed in every seat in the
train. After they had time to look the paper over, the editor went
through the train and made their acquaintance. He so ingratiated
himself with them that by the time the train reached Dallas, they
were nearly all ready to come on to Fort Worth, to which place he
promised them free transportation. That night he preempted every
seat in the stage coaches and engaged hacks for the rest of the party.
They spent the night at the Crutchfield Hotel and in the morning
were to have had a reception by the business men. General W. L.
Cabell was the mayor of the town. When the hour for the reception
arrived there was no one to receive. They had gone to Fort Worth,
where they had a royal good time. Later some of them settled in Tarrant
County. Mayor Cabell said he had heard of thefts of every kind
but that it was the first time he ever heard of any one stealing an
excursion.</p>
<h2 id="c30"><span class="small">NEITHER COMPLETE NOR INFALLIBLE.</span></h2>
<p>There is no pretense that these pages are a complete history
of the early days of the city. There are many things, and some of them
of importance and interest that have not been mentioned. Many persons
of note who have contributed to the growth of the city are not
enumerated herein. This is because the memory is faulty and not
with a wish to withhold credit from any. Such as it is, it will serve
to refresh the memory of some and be of interest to others who are
not familiar with the struggles through which Fort Worth went
and from which it emerged with success.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project

Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
